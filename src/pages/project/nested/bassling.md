**Bassling** aka Jason Richardson is a musician based in Leeton, New South Wales. For a bit over a decade he's been experimenting with contact microphones, which are used to reveal the resonances within objects. 

> "In a way they invert your soundscape, as you are hearing the vibrations of the landscape from a point within. A point influenced by the physical properties of the object."

Jason was introduced to contact mics in 2004 via the work of Dr Alan Lamb, who built a large aeolian harp with Scott Baker outside of Wagga Wagga. The large scale of Lambâ€™s wires magnify the landscape and encourage close listening, as the constantly shifting harmonics respond to wind and temperature and more.

> "Listening to the wires led me to start sampling the environment and to think of it as an instrument."

In 2012 Jason celebrated the centenary of Leeton with a project that made music using playgrounds. It was a comment on the youthful age of the town and explored the idea of finding beauty in human-made landscapes. He links this idea to the Futurist Art of Noises manifesto from a century earlier.

More recently Jason has sampled my suburb of Willimbong for an exhibition in London.

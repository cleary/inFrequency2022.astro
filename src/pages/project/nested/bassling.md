**Bassling** aka Jason Richardson is a musician based in Leeton, New South Wales. He's been experimenting for decades with contact microphones, which are used to reveal the resonances within objects. 

> "In a way they invert your soundscape, as you are hearing the vibrations of the landscape from a point within. A point influenced by the physical properties of the object."

An interest in site-specific work has made landscapes a theme in Jason's creative practise.

> "Richardson is defining a niche of playful, minimalist music... I love the inventiveness, the
audacity and the fun." - *Playgroundology*

In addition to exhibiting in galleries, Richardson publishes music and videos using the
pseudonym Bassling.

In 2019 he published Earthwords as part of his solo exhibition at Griffith Regional Art Gallery.

> “His interdisciplinary approach is shaped by concepts found in literature and poetry, classical
and modern art as well as underground music.” - *Gallery media release*

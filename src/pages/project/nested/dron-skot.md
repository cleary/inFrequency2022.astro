Based in Bermagui on Djringanj land of the Yuin People on the far south coast, Baker is a multidisciplinary digital artist pushing pixels since when floppy disks were currency and CD-ROMs were too expensive. 

Agile and adaptable, he works across live performance, audiovisual installation and large-scale projections exploring site-specific responses. 

Youâ€™ll find him facilitating immersive art experiences (The (Un)Usual, Trail of Light and Sound), doing visuals at festivals (Rainbow Serpent, Giiyong) and operas (Pinchgut Opera), projecting visuals on ski runs (Illuminate Thredbo) or performing under the musical aliases Abre Ojos (drone) or Dron Skot (noisy techno).

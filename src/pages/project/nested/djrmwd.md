He likes to think that anyone can do this music stuff, but probably shouldn’t.

A founding member of the System Corrupt society for broken electronics, too-fast music you
can’t dance to.

Previous musical incarnations have been described as:

> “a cultural critique of today's karaoke-driven pop idol culture, but I'll leave that to others; I've
been too busy laughing.” 
*Peter Marsh, BBC, 2004.*

> “a neat, well-executed parody (or extension of a form, I’m not quite sure which)" 
*Gail Priest, Realtime, 2011.*

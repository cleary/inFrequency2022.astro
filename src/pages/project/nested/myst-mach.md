**Myst Mach** aka Gizmo, is an experimental musician/sound designer from the far south coast, NSW. 

With influences from Industrial, Jungle/Drum’n’Bass, Techno & whatever the hell she found on online, Myst Mach seeks to push the sonic limitations of whatever genre she feels like messing around with that month.

> "I usually take the structures of said genre & break them down to their elements then rebuild them as something of my own."

As a DJ she continues this genre melding in a more direct way of mixing genres into each other to create a delicious audio soup.

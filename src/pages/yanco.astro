            <p>The inFrequency tour rumbled through Yanco on a Saturday night as a diverse line-up brought their audiovisual performances to town.</p>

            <p>Griffith's <a href="/project/nested/bernard-gray">Bernard Gray</a> shared his experience in live-coding at a workshop during the afternoon, then demonstrated the flexibility of this approach with a set that leapt from a jazzy opening into distorted beats before cooling off with a funky break that he seemed to materialise through programming on his keyboard.</p>

            <p><a href="/project/nested/bassling">Bassling</a> brought a collection of synthesisers onstage to accompany video projections and audio-activated visuals.</p>

            <p><a href="/project/nested/dron-skot">Dron Skot's</a> techno pummelled the sound system and brought a cheer from the Chinese restaurant next door. (Thanks Lee and Donny!)</p>

            <p><a href="/project/nested/djrmwd">DJ Ruined My Wedding Day</a> walked a fine line between giving the crowd the pop music they thought they knew, then perverting it into hardcore rave.</p>

            <p><a href="/project/nested/myst-mach">Myst-Mach's</a> performance began with an audience singalong to 'Promiscuous' by Nelly Furtado, then channeled the spirit of Sophie with a DJ set accompanied with dancing and manipulated video with raunch turned to 11.</p>

            <p>The All Services Club provided a warm and friendly venue, as well as being enthusiastic in their support for the event.</p>
